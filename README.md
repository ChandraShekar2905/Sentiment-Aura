## Demo

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/ChandraShekar2905/Sentiment-Aura](https://github.com/ChandraShekar2905/Sentiment-Aura)

> This application was previously deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, Route 53). See the Quick Start section below to run it locally.

---

## Overview

Sentiment Aura captures your voice, transcribes it in real-time, analyzes the emotional sentiment using AI, and transforms those emotions into a living, breathing visual experience. The Perlin noise visualization dynamically responds to your emotional tone through color, flow patterns, and motion characteristics.

**To try it:** Clone the repository and follow the Quick Start guide below. Grant microphone permission, click the mic icon, and speak naturally. Watch how your emotions transform into visual art in real-time.

## Visualization Design

### Sentiment → Visual Parameter Mapping

The Perlin noise visualization responds to emotional sentiment through multiple parameters that change simultaneously:

| Sentiment Score | Color (RGB) | Flow Pattern | Particle Speed | Noise Scale | Visual Character |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **+0.9 to +1.0** | Yellow (255,210,80) | Large smooth waves | 0.5x SLOW | 0.003 | Calm, peaceful, warm glow |
| **+0.5 to +0.8** | Orange (250,150,70) | Gentle flowing | 0.7x Slower | 0.004 | Content, pleasant |
| **-0.2 to +0.2** | Purple (140,140,160) | Balanced patterns | 1.0x Normal | 0.005 | Neutral, steady |
| **-0.5 to -0.3** | Blue (100,120,200) | Turbulent swirls | 1.3x Faster | 0.008 | Agitated, restless |
| **-0.9 to -0.6** | Deep Blue (70,100,180) | Chaotic, rapid | 1.6x FAST | 0.012 | Distressed, turbulent |

### Technical Implementation

**Perlin Noise Engine:**
- **3D Noise Field:** (x, y, time) creates organic, continuous patterns
- **2500 Particles:** Each follows force vectors from the noise field
- **Grid-based Forces:** Flow field calculated on a grid (width/20 x height/20)
- **Smooth Interpolation:** All parameters (color, speed, noise) transition gradually
- **Trail Effect:** Semi-transparent background creates motion trails
- **Edge Wrapping:** Particles wrap around screen edges for infinite flow

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Particle count balanced for 50-60 FPS
- Efficient force calculation using grid
- Optimized stroke rendering
- No memory leaks (proper p5.js cleanup)

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Perlin Noise?

Perlin noise creates **organic, natural-looking patterns** that feel alive and emotional - perfect for representing human sentiment. Unlike pure random noise:
- Produces smooth, continuous variations
- Feels natural to human perception
- Allows for controllable complexity
- Creates beautiful, hypnotic flow patterns

Kenneth Perlin won an Academy Award for this technique used in CGI!

### Why Speed Variation Based on Sentiment?

Grounded in **emotional psychology research:**
- **Positive emotions** correlate with calmness, peace, and slower perception of time
- **Negative emotions** correlate with agitation, anxiety, and racing thoughts
- **Color psychology:** Warm colors (yellow/orange) = happiness; Cool colors (blue) = sadness

The slow flow for happiness and fast flow for distress **mirrors these psychological states**, creating an intuitive emotional resonance.

### Why Liquid Glass UI?

The semi-transparent frosted glass aesthetic:
- **Allows visualization to remain visible** - UI doesn't obscure the art
- **Creates depth and layering** - Modern, premium feel
- **Matches Memory Machines' brand** - Clean, futuristic, sophisticated
- **Maintains readability** - Sufficient contrast without being opaque
- **Apple-inspired** - Draws from industry-leading design language

### Why Real-Time vs Batch Processing?

Real-time provides:
- **Immediate feedback loop** - Users see results as they speak
- **Natural interaction** - Feels like a conversation, not a tool
- **Continuous engagement** - Visualization evolves dynamically
- **Lower latency** - No waiting for analysis to complete
